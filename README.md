# ePortfolio
## April Rose SNHU CS499 Capstone
### Self Assesment

Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing my ePortfolio has significantly helped me showcase my strengths and shape my professional goals. As a construction manager and electrical engineer, this program has equipped me with technical skills that complement my primary field of work and support my career aspirations. While my focus remains on electrical systems for launch towers, the knowledge gained from courses in computer science—such as software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and security—has broadened my technical toolkit, enabling me to approach engineering challenges with a more analytical and tech-driven mindset.

One key takeaway from the program is the value of self-directed work. Although I did not participate in group projects or communicate with external stakeholders during this program, I still had to rely heavily on my ability to learn independently and manage tasks without external collaboration. This experience has mirrored many of the challenges I face in my field, where complex projects often require me to work autonomously while meeting strict deadlines and ensuring all technical aspects are aligned. For example, I tackled problems involving algorithms and data structures on my own, which enhanced my ability to think critically about how to optimize solutions. These problem-solving skills are transferrable to my engineering projects, where I must optimize electrical systems, manage complex resources, and make real-time decisions based on data.

The coursework in data structures and algorithms gave me the foundation to approach data in a more organized and efficient way. Although I didn't use MongoDB in my coursework, I worked with relational databases, which are foundational in my professional work for managing project data. For instance, understanding the logic behind database queries and data manipulation improves my ability to handle large datasets related to project budgets, timelines, and resource allocation. This technical understanding of data structures will also be invaluable as I continue to adopt new tools in the construction and aerospace industries, where the demand for data-driven decision-making is increasing.

Software engineering principles were integral to my studies, particularly in developing and maintaining code that is efficient, secure, and scalable. Even though I didn’t collaborate on group projects or engage with stakeholders outside of my professor, the focus on individual problem-solving through secure coding practices, including handling SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, has shaped my mindset around building resilient systems. These principles directly relate to ensuring the integrity and security of electrical systems in my field, where safety and accuracy are paramount.

Security in the context of my coursework was emphasized through projects that dealt with vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks. While my direct application of security practices isn't in software development, the importance of protecting data—whether it's sensitive client information or project resources—has parallels in my industry. The awareness gained through this coursework makes me more mindful of how vulnerabilities can affect operational systems, even in non-software environments.

Together, my coursework and the artifacts developed in this ePortfolio present a clear picture of my growth and evolving skills in computer science. Each project, whether related to software design, database management, or security, has played a role in helping me develop a comprehensive understanding of these technical areas. This ePortfolio reflects my ability to integrate these skills into real-world scenarios, including their application to my field of work in construction and engineering.

In conclusion, completing the program and developing the ePortfolio has provided me with a broader skill set that supports both my current work and future goals. The technical abilities gained in algorithms, database management, software engineering, and security will help me better manage complex engineering projects and stay adaptable to technological advancements in my industry. As I move forward in my career, I am confident that the foundational knowledge gained in this program will allow me to integrate cutting-edge technologies into my work, improving efficiency and innovation in the aerospace and construction sectors.
